<h1>Systematic Status of the Colubrid Snake,<br />
Leptodeira discolor G&uuml;nther</h1>

<p class="center">BY</p>

<p class="center">WILLIAM E. DUELLMAN</p>


<p>At the time of completing my study of the genus <i>Leptodeira</i>
(1958) I had seen no specimens of <i>Leptodeira discolor</i>, a species
described by G&uuml;nther in 1860 and subsequently referred to the
genus <i>Hypsiglena</i> by Cope (1887), Boulenger (1894), and Mocquard
(1908), and to the genus <i>Pseudoleptodeira</i> by Taylor (1938).
G&uuml;nther's description was based on two syntypes (British Museum
of Natural History numbers 1946.1.23.67 and 68) collected in
Oaxaca, M&eacute;xico, by Auguste Sall&eacute;. Information concerning the
scutellation and coloration of the syntypes was provided by J. C.
Battersby; in my revisionary study (<i>op. cit.</i>) this information was
included in a short discussion of the species, which was referred to
<i>incerta sedis</i> until specimens could be examined and the relationships
of the species determined.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of John M. Legler of the Museum of Natural
History, University of Kansas, I have been able to study a
specimen of <i>Leptodeira discolor</i> obtained six miles southeast of
Tamazul&aacute;pam, Oaxaca, M&eacute;xico, by J. R. Alcorn on June 22, 1955.
Superficial examination of the external characters of this snake
shows a striking resemblance to <i>Leptodeira</i>. The specimen has a
vertical pupil, divided anal, 21 scale rows, and two apical pits. The
enlarged posterior maxillary teeth are without a trace of a groove.
Examination of the hemipenis revealed that the organ was bifurcate
and had a forked sulcus; these penial characteristics are diagnostic
of the subfamily Xenodontinae and not the subfamily Colubrinae
that includes the genera <i>Hypsiglena</i> and <i>Leptodeira</i>.</p>

<p>Examination of all available xenodontine genera indicates that
this snake belongs to a heretofore unnamed genus. In recognition
of the mental torment customarily suffered by workers attempting
to ascertain the relationships of the many genera of colubrid snakes,
I propose the generic name</p>

317-318, 1860.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;A xenodontine colubrid snake having a bifurcate hemipenis with
a forked sulcus spermaticus, many longitudinal folds on basal portion, and small
spines and calyces on distal part; 12 or 13 maxillary teeth followed by short
diastema and two somewhat enlarged maxillary teeth lacking grooves; small
parotid gland; normal colubrid skull; no hypapophyses on posterior vertebrae;
elliptical pupils; two apical pits; smooth scales; normal colubrid head shields;
divided anal; paired caudals.</p>

<p>The generic name comes from the Greek &#932;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#963;, a mythological character
symbolic of eternal torment, and from the Greek &#959;&#966;&#953;&#963; for snake.</p></div>


<p class="center"><b>Tantalophis discolor</b> (G&uuml;nther) New comb.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The synonymy for the species is indicated in the account of the genus. The
description below of the species is based on an adult male from 6 miles southeast
of Tamazul&aacute;pam, Oaxaca, M&eacute;xico (University of Kansas Museum of Natural
History No. 40143).</p>

<p><i>Scutellation.</i>&mdash;Head shields normal; upper labials 7-7 (third and fourth
entering orbit); lower labials 9-9 (1-4 in contact with anterior chin-shield,
4 and 5 in contact with posterior chin-shield); preoculars 1-1 and not in contact
with frontal; postoculars 2-2; temporals 1-2-3, 1-2-3; nasals divided by a
distinct groove below nostril and faint groove above; portion of rostral visible
from above, one-third length of internasals; internasals pentagonal and one-half
as long as prefrontals; parietal suture approximately as long as frontal; ventrals
178; anal divided; caudals 80. Scales in 21 rows at midbody and showing the
following reduction:</p>

<p class="center">
2 + 3 (130)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 + 9 (162)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; 19&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; 17 (178)<br />
2 + 3 (130)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 + 9 (152)<br />
</p>

<p><i>Coloration.</i>&mdash;Dorsal ground-color light brown and extending onto edges of
ventrals; transverse body blotches numbering 50, each 1&frac12; to 3 scales long and
separated by light interspaces 1&frac12; to 2 scales long; blotches brownish black and
extending onto second scale row; lateral intercalary spots forming dark smudges
on rows 1 and 2. Top of head black, flecked with tan; nape cream, followed
by dark band six scales long; dark nape stripe from posterior edges of parietals
to first dark body band. Venter cream-tan; throat and labials cream; posterior
margins of all upper labials and of lower labials 1-3 black-edged (Figure 1).</p>

<p><i>Size and Proportions.</i>&mdash;Head and body 312 mm. long; tail 118 mm., amounting
to 37.8 per cent of length of head and body.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;Data on the syntypes of <i>Leptodeira discolor</i> furnished by J. C.
Battersby give some indication of the variation in the species. Both are males,
and they have 175 and 180 ventrals, 88 and 89 caudals, 1 preocular, 2 postoculars,
1-2-3 temporals, 7 and 8 upper labials, 9 lower labials. They have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
body lengths of 365 and 402 mm., total lengths of 509 and 555 mm., tail/body
ratios of 38.0 and 39.4. They have 51 and 54 dark blotches on the body.</p>

<p><i>Skull.</i>&mdash;The skull is typically colubrid and shows no modifications. The
quadrate has both a median and a lateral depression, forming a strong lateral
flange on the anterior edge; the columellar process is elliptical, and the supracolumellar
crest is robust. The posteroinferior vomerine process extends directly
posteriorly and then angles sharply posterodorsally, enclosing an elliptical
vomerine fenestra. The lateral processes of the premaxillary are slightly
pointed; the median spine is relatively thin and high. The pterygoids bear
23 and 21 teeth that decrease in size posteriorly; the transpalatine articulating
process of the pterygoid is rounded, not robust; the lateral crest is high and
moderately robust; the depression in the ventral surface of the pterygoid is
moderate. There are 12 and 13 maxillary teeth that increase in size posteriorly;
these are followed by a short diastema and two larger, solid teeth. The
prediastemal teeth are slightly curved and slender. The maxillary is laterally
compressed; the posterior knob is not robust; there is one foramen in the
lateral face of the bone (Figure 2). The 10 palatine teeth are almost uniform
in size; the dentary bears 19 teeth that decrease in size posteriorly.</p>

</div>

<p>A thin and otherwise small parotid gland or "venom sac" extends posteriorly
from beneath the eye to about the angle of the jaw; a minute duct
connects with the anteromedian surface and extends to the fleshy part of the
mouth at the posterior end of the maxillary (Figure 3).</p>

</div>

<p><i>Hemipenis.</i>&mdash;In <i>situ</i> the hemipenis extends to the posterior edge of the
thirteenth caudal. The unforked part of the organ is bedecked with numerous
heavy longitudinal folds alternating with thinner folds. The basal parts of
the two heads are covered with moderate sized spines, those closest to the base
and the sulcus being the smallest. The distal parts of the heads are covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
with calyces. The sulcus bifurcates on the unforked part of the organ at a
point about two-thirds of the distance from the base to the division of the
organ. The sulcus is a deep groove between heavy folds proximally and is a
shallower furrow distally (Figure 4).</p>

</div>

<p><i>Relationships.</i>&mdash;Using Dunn's (1928) arrangement of the American
colubrid snakes as a guide permits the taxonomist to group
<i>Tantalophis</i> with several genera, some of which occur in South
America and others in the West Indies. Although the significance
of such generic characters as scale pits and nature of the hemipenis
is not clear, these characters must, of necessity, be utilized in attempting
to ascertain the relationships of <i>Tantalophis</i> to other
colubrid snakes. Assuming that the primary divisions of the
American colubrids into subfamilies based on the nature of the
sulcus spermaticus and the presence or absence of hypapophyses on
the posterior vertebrae have some reality, <i>Tantalophis</i> must be
placed in the subfamily Xenodontinae comprising genera chiefly
South American in their distribution, but with several genera in
Middle America and a few in North America and the West Indies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
In order to limit the number of genera to be compared with <i>Tantalophis</i>,
only those xenodontines having apical pits and bifurcate
hemipenis are considered. These include <i>Cyclagras</i>, <i>Drepanoides</i>,
<i>Hypsirhynchus</i>, <i>Ialtris</i>, <i>Leimadophis</i>, <i>Pseudablabes</i>, <i>Siphlophis</i>,
<i>Tachymenis</i>, <i>Tomodon</i>, and <i>Trypanurgos</i>. Aside from differences in
scutellation, <i>Leimadophis</i>, <i>Siphlophis</i>, and <i>Trypanurgos</i> have the
heads of the hemipenes terminating in a disc, and <i>Ialtris</i> has a plicate
hemipenis. <i>Tomodon</i> has basal spines on the hemipenis. The
hemipenes of the other genera have proximal folds, distal spines, and
distal calyces, not greatly unlike the condition found in <i>Tantalophis</i>.
Of these, <i>Cyclagras</i>, <i>Hypsirhynchus</i>, and <i>Pseudablabes</i> have round
pupils and certain differences in scutellation. <i>Drepanoides</i> and
<i>Tachymenis</i> have elliptical pupils like those of <i>Tantalophis</i>, but
<i>Tachymenis</i> has only one apical pit, and <i>Drepanoides</i> has one apical
pit or none. In the above characters no especially close relationship
between <i>Tantalophis</i> and any one of these genera is apparent.</p>

<p>If the characteristics usually employed in distinguishing and relating
genera are ignored and other more subjective criteria are
used, the relationships of <i>Tantalophis</i> still remain obscure. Of the
xenodontine genera <i>Tantalophis</i> approaches <i>Leimadophis</i> in general
physiognomy; perhaps it represents an early divergent stock of
<i>Leimadophis</i> that has undergone radical changes in the hemipenis
and other characters. On the other hand, if the nature of the hemipenis
is of no importance in defining supergeneric groups of colubrid
snakes, <i>Tantalophis</i> may have its relationships with <i>Leptodeira</i>
and <i>Hypsiglena</i>. Although herpetologists have been working intensively
on American colubrids for many decades, the relationships
of the majority of the groups are not well understood. Until
the hemipenes and skulls of all of the forms have been studied and
compared, and the evolutionary significance has been determined
for the characters of the hemipenes, dentition, and apical pits, our
knowledge of the relationships of these snakes will be incomplete.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The individual on which this paper is based is the
only specimen of the species with definite locality data. It is from
a locality six miles southeast of Tamazul&aacute;pam in northwestern
Oaxaca. This town lies at an elevation of about 6500 feet in the
upper reaches of the Balsas Basin, an arid interior valley that expands
in its upper end to form a broad basin of rolling and dissected
terrain ranging from about 4000 to 6800 feet in elevation. The
countryside around Tamazul&aacute;pam is arid and supports plants of the
genera <i>Prosopis</i>, <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Ipomoea</i>, and <i>Cassia</i>, and also columnar
cacti. Oaks and pines grow on the limestone hills rising above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
rolling valley. <i>Tantalophis</i> may be endemic to the Balsas Basin, as
are many other species of reptiles. However, if the snake has its
relatives to the south in lower Central America and South America,
such a distribution seems unlikely, even for an apparent relict.</p>

<p><i>Acknowledgments.</i>&mdash;For permission to study and report on this
specimen I am indebted to Dr. E. Raymond Hall and Mr. John M.
Legler. I am grateful to Dr. Laurence C. Stuart for many helpful
suggestions and to Dr. Norman E. Hartweg for placing at my disposal

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
